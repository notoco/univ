<h2>Easy switch between different audio settings.</h2>

Save audio settings to profiles and easy switch between them using keymap or pop-up menu:

<pre>RunScript(script.audio.profiles,0) - one keymap to toggle switch between two profiles. </pre>
<pre>RunScript(script.audio.profiles,x) - where x is number of profile</pre>

<h2>Information</h2>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
Repeat Step 2 and set settings for digital like SPDIF or HDMI and save as second profile

<h3>Step 4</h3>
No you can switch between profiles using key map. I suggest to test it on keyboard keymap.
Edit or create file keyboard.xml in userdata/keymaps/ and past this code:

Example 1 - keymap for each profile:
<pre>
&lt;keymap>
  &lt;global>
    &lt;keyboard>
      &lt;t>RunScript(script.audio.profiles,1)&lt;/t>
      &lt;a>RunScript(script.audio.profiles,2)&lt;/a>
    &lt;/keyboard>
  &lt;/global>
&lt;/keymap>
</pre>

Example 2 - keymap for toggle between profiles:
<pre>
&lt;keymap>
  &lt;global>
    &lt;keyboard>
      &lt;t>RunScript(script.audio.profiles,0)&lt;/t>
    &lt;/keyboard>
  &lt;/global>
&lt;/keymap>
</pre>

Example 3 - Window Popup when start playing
In addon settings enable option "Show audio stream select menu on start playing". This will show popup to choose audio profile every time when you start play.

Example 4 - Automatic switch for different content
In Addon settings go to category "Automatic switch" then select for which types of content which profile will be automatically switched on.
